# run-apache-foreground

# This file contains the basic instruction for running Apache in foreground mode.

# It sets the environment variables, create the runtime directories and runs Apache

# Note that this script was tested in Fedora and Slackware, possibly runs in Centos,RHCE,OVL, and other Distros based on Red Hat or Slackware.

# It's bare minimun, made for use with Docker, and if you want something complex, take a look in the init script of you distro or dig GitHub :)
